##  System Integration

- **Communication Protocols**:
  - MAVLink (USB-TTL between Raspberry Pi and CubePilot)
  - Telemetry (UART) for real-time GCS monitoring
- **Mission Software**:
  - [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/planner/)
- **Autonomous Control**:
  - Python scripts running on Raspberry Pi
  - Used MAVROS and DroneKit for ROS-based flight command automation
- **Failsafes**:
  - Battery monitoring
  - Emergency auto-landing


---

##  Software Architecture

- **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
- **Libraries**: MAVROS, MAVSDK, DroneKit, ROS Noetic
- **Control Flow**:
  - Single auto-start command ‚Üí Takeoff ‚Üí Hover ‚Üí Land
  - Loiter mode is enabled using Optical Flow
- **Flight Modes**:  
  - `OFFBOARD` (via MAVROS)  
  - `ALTHOLD`, `LOITER` for stability in GPS-denied environments  
- **Failsafe Scripts**:  
  - Safe descent & landing if anomalies detected

##  Testing & Results

| Test | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Motor & ESC Calibration | Fixed yaw instability, balanced thrust |
| Altitude Hold Mode | Stable hover using LiDAR & PID tuning |
| Initial Autonomous Takeoff | Achieved, but required script corrections |
| 10s Autonomous Hover | Success with ALTHOLD mode |
| Final Test (30s Hover + Loiter Landing) | Fully successful |
